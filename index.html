            <p>
              You are a 32 year old widowed mother from Ridgeport, Mississippi.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before your husband died, you were a stay-at-home mother who left your career to take care of your two children, Paul and Jane. After his death, you found it difficult to pay for your two-story home, especially after being out of the job-market for so long. You've since moved into a small 2-bedroom apartment in a different neighborhood with cheaper housing.
            </p>
            <p>
              You've recently got a job as a waitress at a local restaurant. It does not pay very well, but it is your primary source of income. You start work at 8AM and leave for home at 6PM.

                Paul is an energetic four-year-old who has just started preschool.
              </p>
              <p>
                Things have been especially tough for him now because he lost his father and because you have to work so often. He's used to being taken everywhere with you, and is having trouble adjusting.
              </p>
              <p>
                You try to treat him with his favorite snacks to accompany the school's free lunch program, since you know he doesn't like it very much.

              <p>
                She had hoped to join the school's theater club, but could not because she babysits Paul after school each day since afterschool is expensive.
              </p>
              <p>
                She has considered babysitting other children in the neighborhood, or finding a job, to help pay for family costs, though you have tried not to let her worry about money.

        <p>
          However, the cost of the groceries you've selected exceed the amount of money on your SNAP card, and you don't have extra cash to pay for anything else.
