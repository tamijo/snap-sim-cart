  "bio": "Alexa Hansen is a 32 year old widowed mother from Ridgeport, Mississippi. After her husband died three months ago, she moved into a small 2-bedroom apartment with her two children, Paul and Sophie. She recently got a job as a waitress at a local restaurant. It does not pay very well, but it is her primary source of income. She starts work at 8AM to and leaves at 6PM. Paul is four years old and suffers from severe asthma. He's very energetic and loves playing outside. He started preschool last month, and he gets homesick easily. It has been especially tough for him now because he lost his father and because his mother has to work so often. Sophie is a bright 14 year old who is a straight-A student and loves theater. She had hoped to join the school's theater club, but could not because she babysits her younger brother after school each day. Today, Alexa has gone to Greenshop, the local supermarket, after spending the day working. She will buy groceries and hopes to return home to spend a little time with her kids before they go to sleep.",
